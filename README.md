# Babel

Repository for the ISAT 461: Internetworking Semester Project: Implementation of Babel Protocol and Hybrid Network Architectures. Project Instructions and Completed Project are written in LaTeX, and compiled in PDF format.

Babel is a Mesh networking protocol that is known as a "loop-avoiding distance vector routing protocol". Its main selling point is that it is efficient in traditional wired network topologies, as well as wireless mesh networks. Babel is said to remain efficient in the presence of networking with unstable routing metrics.

This Semester project walks through a number of exercises to understand the advantages to the Babel Protocol, as well as understanding other fundamentals, such as configuring OpenWRT firmware on an Asus NT-66U Router and GNS3/CORE Network simulators.
